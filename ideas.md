Ideas to implement:

- Set wifi credentials and pi user password
- install.sh shell script that installs node and this system as a systemd service, can be downloaded with wget like NodeSource PPA
- Upload project through web
- Upload project through CLI
- Create systemd service for project through web
- Get systemctl status and logs for project through web
- Configure project with --inspect-brk so it can be remotely debugged with VS Code et al.
